Trying to understand `monads`? Yey! me too!! Let me tell you this, if anyone tells you `monads` are simple don't beleive him.  If anyone tells you if have `unit` and `bind` you have a monad you see that is simple, you get what `unit` is right? you get what `bind` is right? so you understand monad! err wrong!
    
Why `monads` the first question to ask is could we be doing well without monads why do we need them at all?
