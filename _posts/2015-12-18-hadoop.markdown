**Jobs management**

1. Master sends the actual `jar` to be executed to data nodes.
1. Hadoop sends data from mappers to reducers even before `mappers` finished in order to have `reducers` be able to already start working.
1. `hadoop jar` is the command that will run your jar (you should have already uploaded it to hadoop cluster with `-put`
1. Show list of running jobs `mapred job -list`

**Scripting languages**

*Hive*

1. Kind of an `SQL` for map reduce jobs.
1. Can add user defined functions.

*Pig*

1. Kind of a `scripting language` for map reduce jobs.

*Impala*

1. Instead of start, read data, write data, those are living servers on hadoop cluster, so much faster (not standard `mapreduce`, not even `mapreduce`)
1. Query language similar to `HiveQL`

**Other Components**
1. Data transfers - `Flume`, `Scoop`
1. Workflow management - `oozie`, `YARN`
