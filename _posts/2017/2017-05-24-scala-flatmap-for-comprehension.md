**Introduction**
I'm not a scala mega mind so feel free to correct me, but this is how I explain the flatMap/map/for-comprehension saga to myself!

To understand `for comprehension` and it's translation to `scala's map / flatMap` we must take small steps and understand the composing parts, `map` and `flatMap`.  But isn't `scala's flatMap` just `map` with `flatten` right? if so why do so many developers find it so hard to get the grasp of it, if you just look at scala's `map` and `flatMap` signature you see they return the same return type `M[B]` and they work on the same input argument `A` (at least the first part to the function they take) if that's so what makes a difference?  `scala's` and in general `flatMap` should not be taken lightly.  It's one of the basics you must understand very well and it's difference from map.

**Our plan**

1. Understand scala's `map`.
1. Understand scala's `flatMap`.
1. Understand scala's `for comprehension`.`

**Scala's map**

scala map signature:

`map[B](f: (A) => B): M[B]`

but there is a big part missing when we lookg at this signature, and it's - where does this `A` comes from? our container is of type `A` so its important to look at this function in the context of the container - `M[A]`.  Our contianer could be a `List` of items of type `A` and our `map` function takes a function which transform each items of type `A` to type `B`, then it returns a container of type `B` (or `M[B]`)

Let's write map's signature taking into account the container:

```scala
M[A]: // We are in M[A] context.
    map[B](f: (A) => B): M[B] // map takes a function which knows to transform A to B and then it bundles them in M[B]
```

Note an **extremely highly highly important fact about map** - it bundles **automatically** in the output container `M[B]` you have no control over it.  Let's us stress it again:

1. `map` chooses the output container for us and its going to be the same container as the source we work on so for `M[A]` container we get the same `M` container only for `B` `M[B]` and nothing else!
1. `map` does this containerization for us we just give a mapping from `A` to `B` and it would put it in the box of `M[B]` will put it in the box for us!

You see you did not specify how to `containerize` the item you just specified how to transform the internal items.  And as we have the same container `M` for both `M[A]` and `M[B]` this means `M[B]` is the same container, meaning if you have `List[A]` then you are going to have a `List[B]` and more importantly `map` is doing it for you!
 
Now that we have dealt with `map` let's move on to `flatMap`.

**Scala's flatMap**

Let's see its signature:

`flatMap[B](f: (A) => M[B]): M[B] // we need to show it how to containerize the A into M[B]`

You see the big difference from map to `flatMap` in flatMap we are providing it with the function that does not just convert from `A to B` but also containerizes it into `M[B]`.

**why do we care who does the containerization?**

So why do we so much care of the input function to map/flatMap does the containerization into `M[B]` or the map itself does the containerization for us?

You see in the context of `for comprehension` what's happening is multiple transformations on the item provided in the `for` so 

**The mighty for comprehension**

Now let's see where in for comprehension at first it does not matter if we use map or flat map.

```scala
val list = List(1,2,3)

for {                           // List(8, 16, 24)
  x <- list
  a = x*2
  b = a*2
  c = b*2
} yield c

list                           // List(8, 16, 24)
  .map(a => a*2)
  .map(b => b*2)
  .map(c => c*2)

list
  .flatMap(a => List(a*2))    // List(8, 16, 24)
  .flatMap(b => List(b*2))
  .flatMap(c => List(c*2))
```

You see :) sometimes it does not matter if you use `map` or `flatMap` :) we could translate the above `for-comprehension` either to `map` or `flatMap` and all is well and we are not stressed!

But we didn't conjure here for this case only we have come here for more cases and we suspect that we would need a differnet combination in order to satisfy the mighty `for-comprehension` lets take another case:
