So you wish to measure how much the `request-response` cycle takes in spray and add it to your set of `metrics`? You have come to the right place, here is the recipe for that.  We are using [codahale-metrics](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics) as our `metrics` framework.

### The routing directive
This is the routing directive we wish to measure

{% highlight scala %}
val helloRoute = path("/hello") {
    get {
      complete("time this from request to response please (and hello to you!)")
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

#### Create metric
val requestResponseTimer = RequestResponseTimedMetric("spray.request.response.timer", metricRegistry).time

`TimedMetric`, warning, magic behind that, we are going to code that class below.

#### Update code to use the timed metric
{% highlight scala %}
val helloRoute = path("/hello") {
    get {
        requestResponseTimer {
            complete("time this from request to response please (and hello to you!)")
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### RequestResponseTimedMetric explained
{% highlight scala %}
  case class TimerMetric(timerName: String, metricRegistry: MetricRegistry) {
    val time: Directive0 =
      around { ctx =>
        val timerContext = metricRegistry.timer(timerName).time()
        val startTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
        (ctx, buildAfter(timerContext, startTime))
      }

    def buildAfter(timerContext: Timer.Context, startTime: Long): Any => Any = { possibleRsp: Any =>
      possibleRsp match {
        case _ =>
          timerContext.stop()
          trace(durationMarker, s"$timerName duration of ${System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime}}")
      }
      possibleRsp
    }

  }

  def around(before: RequestContext => (RequestContext, Any => Any)): Directive0 =
    mapInnerRoute { inner =>
      ctx =>
        val (ctxForInnerRoute, after) = before(ctx)
        try inner(ctxForInnerRoute.withRouteResponseMapped(after))
        catch { case NonFatal(ex) => after(Failure(ex)) }
    }
{% endhighlight %}

1. `TimedMetric` is just a `case class` which receives the timer name and the `metricsRegistry`
1. `TimerMetric.time` returns a `function` because it returns a call to `around` and `around` is a function from `before: RequestContext` to the output which is `(RequestContext, Any => Any)`.
1. Note the output has the `RequestContext` because you wish to have the `request` when handling response that would be nice.
1. Note the output outcome is `Any => Any` which means it's just a general function whatever you coded to handle the request.
1. `around` then runs `before` on context then `inner` then `after` its a general wrapper.
1. `TimerMetric.time` calls the `around` and as a code block to execute it passes the `timer` starting and stopping.
1. So when you called TimerMetric.time you are passing it a `block` to run because `.time` runs `around` and `around` receives a `code block` and the code block you are passing to it is the actual code to run.  However `.time` does not only run that code it also creates the actual `metrics` timer initializes it records the `startTime` and creates another block to be run the `after` which is the `buildAfter(timerContext, startTime)
1. The `around` knows to run that `after` code block after the whole run of the code block to run has finishes, by having `ctxForInnerRoute.withRouteResponseMapped(after)`
