The big VS of software development
---------
1. Dynamic VS Static typed languages the hall of grail.
1. Scheme VS Schemaless persistency.
1. SQL VS NoSQL (which usually actually is document vs relational model) appears to have been resolved relational vs document store see book designing data intensive applications.  It appears it would end up in a marriage and the outcome would be a hybrid relational document databases as already some relational database take roles of storing plain jsons and document databases take the roles of allowing some limited SQL like query language.
1. Lean features languages (Go) vs packed with features languages (Scala).
1. Brackets (LISP) style vs C styled languages.
1. Functional VS object oriented.  We are now at round 3 of the game, it started with functional moved to OO and now its back to functional it may end up with marriage of those techniques as seen by scala.
